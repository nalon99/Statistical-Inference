Statistical-Inference
=====================

This is my repository about some simple simulations using R and knitr, just in case it might be useful to whom is looking for a simple explanation of tricky concepts.

All the markdown files have been created with RStudio and Knitr, then the PDF files have been rendered with Pandoc.
